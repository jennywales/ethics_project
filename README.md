# Should Facial Recognition Systems be Regulated? - a Data Ethics Project

This is a presentation created to dicuss ethical issues around facial recognition systems, whether they should be regulated,
and what kind of regulations could be implemented.

# Project Brief

Facial recognition technology is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in society and has the potential to make everything from 
passing through airports to unlocking your phone seamless. However, there are still significant privacy challenges, 
particularly where technology is deployed in public spaces. Amazon’s Rekognition AI technology has known accuracy issues, 
especially with females and darker skin tones.

We’d like you to consider both how the existing systems should be regulated and also how we stop false positive matches by 
improving commercially available algorithms.

# Code Used

The presentation was built in RStudio, and is an RMarkdown presentation with a CSS file to personalise the design. 

# Features

The presentation explains how facial recognition systems (FRS) work, as well as the sectors that use FRS such as the police and 
retail. Biases in FRS are then discussed with case studies, as well as privacy concerns around the use of the technology. 
The presentation concludes by discsussing possible methods to reduce bias in FRS, as well as different methods of regulation.
